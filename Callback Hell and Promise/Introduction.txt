What is callback hell?

When a number of task is to be perfomed sequentially,code become messy as no of taska increases.
Let's uderstand it by an exampple
we have three task first , second and third to be executed sequentially that means later function can be start executing
only after former is finished.

Code snippet:

function first(val,callback)
{
    callback(val + "first",false);
}

function second(val,callback)
{
    callback(val + "second",false);
}

function third(val,callback)
{
    callback(val + "third",false);
}

function MainFunc()
{
    var val = "Zero ";
    first(val,function(val,err)
    {
       if(!err)
       {
           second(val,function(val,err)
               {
                   if(!err)
                   {
                        third(val,function (val,err) {
                            if(!err)
                            {
                                console.info("message is " + val);
                            }
                            else
                            {
                                console.log("Error in third");
                            }
                        });
                   }
                   else
                   {
                       console.log("Error in second");
                   }
               }
           );
       }
       else
       {
           console.log("Error in first");
       }
    });
}

MainFunc();

You can see code will be more messy , if no of task would be larger.
This is callback hell.
