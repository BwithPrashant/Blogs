How Node.Js works?

Node js is single threaded,non blocking and asynchronous.

Non blocking and asynchronous-> while performing time consuming tasks ,
								other tasks are also running in parallel

It has a call stack , webapi's and event queue.
When a time consuming task like database access,I/0 operation etc. arrives,It goes to call stack and dissapeared
instantly and goes to web api's. Now once it's executed , it is transferred to event queue.Now whenever stack becomes
empty , events from event queue is popped and pushed to call stack.

That's how Node js works asynchronously in single threaded way.
