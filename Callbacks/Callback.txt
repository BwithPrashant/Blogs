What is Callback?

Callback is a function that can be passed in a function as an argument.
Basically you are passing a reference to a function as parameter.

For better understanding , let's take an example in javascript.

Here is the code snippet:-

function fun(a,b)
{
    console.log("Message is  " + a + " " + b);
}
function MainFunc()
{
    ShowUserName("Hello ",x);
	//Do some other work.
}
function ShowUserName(greeting,callback)
{
	//suppose it is fetched from database
    var name = "prashant";
    callback(greeting,name);
}
MainFunc();

The purpose of MainFunc() is to display welcome messege , but in this function only greeting ("Hello") is known.
Username will be fetched from username, So in ShowUserName() we passed the greeting and callback function as well.
Now it is useful in case of async programming. In MainFunc() ,we just called ShowUserName() and now we are not 
bothering about time taken in database access.We can perform other tasks now.Meanwhile when username will be fetched
from database it will be displayed.
That's the beauty of callback.
