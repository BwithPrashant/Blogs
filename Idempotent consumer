In an entriprise application , it is good to have a message broker which guarntees the message delivery to consumer at least once.
It might leads to sending same message multiple times to the consumer. Consumer should also handle the duplicate message properly. One side effect can be, 
that consumer is processing the same message repeatedly. e.g. Once consumer recieves an account balance , it debit an amount x from the total balance. 
Suppose the same account balance got debited multiple times , it can lead to incorrect account balance in the end. 
    So there is a need of implementing Idempotent consumer, who can handle dupliocate message gracefully. Some consumers are idempotent naturally. 
We can make a consumer idempotent by :-
1. Maintaining a database table , where we store id of message gennerated by business entities. Each time a new message received , we check for the 
duplicacy by querying by ID into the database.
2. Use a separete PROCESSED_MESSAGE table. Here we are checking the message itself for duplicay into PROCESSED_MESSAGE table.
